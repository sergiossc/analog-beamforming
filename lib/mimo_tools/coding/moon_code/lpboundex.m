% the simplex1 function expects _equality_ constraints.  To solve our
% problem, which is set up in terms of _inequality_ contstraints, introduce
% surplus variables.
% For example, an inequality of the form
%  4x_1 + 3x_2 >= -4,   x_1 >=0,  x_2 >= 0
% can be written as
%  4x_1 + 3x_2 - y_1 >= -4,    x_1 >= 0,  x_2 >=0,  y_1 >= 0
%
% To add these surplus variables, Amat is adjoined with a -identity,
% the c vector is adjoined to a vector of 0s.
%
% Also, since simplex1 want to _minimize_, while we want to maximize,
% we use a -c vector.
% 
% The bmat passed in is obtained, of course, by simply moving
% the column of constant terms to the other side.

Amat = [Amat -eye(size(Amat,1))];		% introduce slack variables
c = [ones(1,length(xidx)) zeros(1,size(Amat,1))]';
[x,value] = simplex1(Amat,-bmat',-c);
